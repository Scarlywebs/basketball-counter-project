# BasketBall Counter Project

This counter app project I created is a basketball scoreboard that shows the scores of the HOME, GUEST, FOUL, PERIOD and TIMER count. You can add to the scoreboard the points +1, +2, +3 to the HOME or GUEST scores. When a set number is reached on HOME or GUEST it adds a point to the FOUL score. 

( The timer on scoreboard doesn't function currently but will add controls to that soon! )

## Features

- You can add points to HOME and GUEST by clicking the number `+1` `+2` `+3` below.
- For every 6 points added to HOME or GUEST score one FOUL will be added. ( This is just to show the testing of the foul score, this is NOT how FOUL actually works in gameplay. )
- The timer is set at a 5 minute interval, once the 5 minutes are up it will add one PERIOD to the score and the timer will start over.
- When you hit `Reset Game` button everything with reset back to zero.
